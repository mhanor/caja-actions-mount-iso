# Caja-Actions Mount ISO file menu
Instructions:
1. Before importing, edit the .desktop file with a text editor, to update the icon file path to a valid file. I've personally used a .png file from www.flaticon.com
2. Import the .desktop file using Caja-Actions Configuration Tool, from Mate Desktop. Click Save to apply.
3. In Caja (the file manager), right click an .iso file to test the new file menu option "Mount ISO".
